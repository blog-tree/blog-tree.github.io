                            TDD can be described with three simple rules.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Do not write any production code until you have first written a test that fails
                                    due to the lack of that code.</li>
                                <li>Do not write more of a test than is sufficient to failâ€”and failing to compile
                                    counts as a failure.</li>
                                <li>Do not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently
                                    failing test.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </TextBlock>

                    </Container>
                </section>
            </>
        );
    }
}
